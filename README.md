# Thoughtshot
Humans are special because we are the only animals who can think.

However there is caveat. 
Experts estimate that the human mind thinks about 60,000 thoughts a day. That's an average of 2500 thoughts per hour. That's incredible as well as worrisome. 

Worrisome because we might lose context of the stories we build up in our minds. All of the grey and white cells' throughout the day work might go waste.

How about screenshotting your thoughts?

A thoughtshot is simply a look at the reflections, thoughts, feelings, or opinions of a person. Thoughtshots place events in a context and give the thinker or reader a reason to be interested.

Chuck long hours of journalling. Use thoughtshot to note down your instaneous thoughts by time of the day. Track your mood throughout a period of time. And make better decisions and thoughts day by day.
