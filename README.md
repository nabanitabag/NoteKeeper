Humans are special because we are only animals which can think.
However there is caveat. Experts estimate that the human mind thinks about 60,000 thoughts a day. That's an average of 2500 thoughts per hour. That's incredible and worrisome. Because we might lose context of the stories we build up in our mind. And all of the grey and white cells work go waste.

How about screenshotting your thoughts?

A thoughtshot is simply a look at the reflections, thoughts, feelings, or opinions of a person. Thoughtshots place events in a context and give the thinker or reader a reason to be interested.
